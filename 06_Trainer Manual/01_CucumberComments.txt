Cucumber - Comments

Comment is basically a piece of code meant for documentation purpose and not for execution. Be it a step definition file or a feature file, to make it more readable and understandable. So, it is important to use/put comments at appropriate places in the file. This also helps while debugging the code. Cucumber feature files can have comments at any place. To put comments, we just need to start the statement with “#” sign.
