JUnit acts as a bridge between these two. So, the flow of execution will look like the following -
Stakeholders write down the feature file.
Step definition file will be created accordingly.
Specify the JUnit runner class to run the series of test cases.
Once we run the JUnit runner class -
It will parse the Gherkin feature file.
It will execute the functions written in the step definition file according to feature file statements.
JUnit will combine the test case result.
It will build the test report in the specified format (which can be html/JSON).
